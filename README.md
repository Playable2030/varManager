Some notes.  
1.Because creating symbolic links under windows requires administrator privileges, running the tool may result in a permission warning.  
2.My English is poor, the interface is a lot of machine translation, I hope you bear with me  
3.This tool will change the folder structure in the AddonPackages directory, so please do not use this tool if this is important to you, or if you enjoy organizing var files.
